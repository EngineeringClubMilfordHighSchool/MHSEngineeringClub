# Milford High School Engineering Club

## About Us

The Milford High School Engineering Club is a vibrant, student-led organization dedicated to exploring the vast and exciting world of engineering and technology. We're a group of passionate students who love to tinker, build, and learn. We provide a platform for students to delve into various engineering disciplines, collaborate on projects, and develop problem-solving skills. All students are welcome, regardless of their academic background or experience level.

We have a special place in our hearts for projects like those seen in that movie with the tesseract â€“ you know, the one every nerd loves!  We're all about pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

This website was created by Gemini, although the club is actively working on a project to teach members how to create websites. Members get hands-on experience during our "Tech Forge" and hackatons!
